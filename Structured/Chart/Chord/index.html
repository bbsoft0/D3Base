			<div id="lotr-intro">
				In more than 11 hours of the LotR trilogy all characters combined speak approximately 32,000 words. The 9 members of the Fellowship alone take up about 17,000 of these words, a bit more than half. In the visualization below you can find out how many words a member has spoken at each general location throughout the trilogy.<br>The members have been sorted from Gandalf who had the most lines, to Legolas, who spoke even less than Boromir, even though the latter was only in one movie (and some extended scenes).</div>

				<div id="lotr-sources">Based on a <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/lotr">many eyes dataset</a> that showed the number of words per character per scene. I then manually added the location per scene by combining movie scripts, maps and my own memory</div>
